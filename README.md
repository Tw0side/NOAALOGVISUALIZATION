# NOAALOGVISUALIZATION

## Overview
NOAALOGVISUALIZATION is a Streamlit-based web application that fetches and visualizes NOAA shipstat data. The application downloads the latest ship log data from the NOAA website, processes it, and displays the data on an interactive map using Folium. Users can explore the latitude and longitude of ships along with additional details like ocean and quadrant.

---

## Features
- **Automatic Data Fetching**: Fetches the latest ship log data from the NOAA website.
- **Interactive Map**: Visualizes ship locations on an interactive map using Folium.
- **Streamlit Frontend**: Provides a user-friendly interface for exploring the data.

---

## Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- `pip` (Python package manager)

---

## Installation and Setup

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone the project repository to your local machine using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tw0side/NOAALOGVISUALIZATION.git
```

### Step 2: Navigate to the Project Directory
Change to the project directory:
```bash
cd NOAALOGVISUALIZATION
```

### Step 3: Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
Create a virtual environment to isolate the project dependencies:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:
- On Linux/Mac:
  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```
- On Windows:
  ```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

### Step 4: Install Dependencies
Install the required Python packages using `pip`:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Running the Application

### Step 1: Start the Streamlit App
Run the Streamlit application using the following command:
```bash
streamlit run fetch.py
```

### Step 2: Access the Application
Once the app is running, Streamlit will provide a local URL (usually `http://localhost:8501`). Open this URL in your web browser to access the application.
